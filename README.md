Summary
In this project, a time series forecasting model was built to predict the household electric power consumption. The dataset was pre-processed and transformed into a time series format. Exploratory data analysis was performed to check the stationarity of the time series data. Finally, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was used to make predictions on the test data. The results of the model showed a good performance, with low errors on both the training and test sets.
